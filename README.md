# Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning

## Subject 1: Introduction to Linear Algebra 📊

    Welcome to the exciting world of linear algebra! Here, we delve into the foundational mathematics that powers modern machine learning algorithms. Let's embark on this journey together.

    ### Understanding Algebra 🧮

    Algebra is not just about numbers; it's a realm where even variables like \( x \) and \( y \) hold significant sway. Consider equations like \( 2x + 5 = 25 \) or \( 2x \). Here, we don't always deal with concrete solutions; sometimes, it's about exploring possibilities.

    ### Exploring Solutions 🎯

    In the algebraic realm, solutions are not always straightforward. We might encounter scenarios with one, none, or infinitely many solutions. It's this unpredictability that adds spice to our mathematical adventures.

    ### Predictive Power 🔮

    Linear algebra isn't just about solving equations; it's a powerful tool for prediction. Think of \( x \) and \( y \) as intercepts guiding us to forecast values and align other variables accordingly. This predictive prowess forms the backbone of regression models.

    ### Tracing Its Origins 🌍

    Let's pay homage to its roots. Algebra traces back to the genius of Al-Khwarizmi, whose Arabic treatise, "Al-jabr," laid the groundwork. It's a journey of completion and balance, echoing through the corridors of mathematical history.

## Concept of Tensors

    What are Tensors ? -> ML generalization of vectors and matrices to any number of dimensions.
        - 0D - Scaler, 1D - Vector, 2D - Matrix, 3D - 3-Tensor, ND - N-Tensor

    1. Scalers.
    2. Vector. (1 dimensional vectors)
    3. Vector transposition.
    4. Zero Vectors. (Scalers 0 dimensional vectors)
    5. Norms are functions that quantify vector magnitude.
    6. L2 norm. Measure simple distance (Euclidean) from origin.
    7. Squared L2 Norm.
    8. Max Norm or Infinity Norm
    9. Generalized Norm.
    10. Basis Vectors ( u = 1.5i + 2j)
    11. Orthogonal Vectors (xTy = 0) 90 angle.
    12. Matrix Tensors. (Two dimensional Array)
    13. Generic Tensor Notation ( n Number of dimensions.)
    14. Higher-Rank Tensors (rank 4 tensors are common for images.)
